# MultiROM-Linker
MultiROM Linker allows you to link multiple ROM images into a single file for burning to EPROM. It is generally used in bank-switched multi-cartridges. You can choose the bank size in the range from 8 kB to 512 kB, and the ROM size in the range from 128k to 1024k.
Use the up and down buttons to change the order of the ROMs. The software also checks the size and number of banks.
